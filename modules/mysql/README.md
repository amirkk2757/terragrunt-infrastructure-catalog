# MySQL on RDS Module

This is an example OpenTofu/Terraform module that deploys a MySQL database using [Amazon's Relational Database Service
(RDS)](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/). See the [root README](/README.md) for instructions on how to provision this module.

Note: This code is meant solely as a simple demonstration of how to lay out your files and folders with
[Terragrunt](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt) in a way that keeps your [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io)
and [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) code DRY. This is not production-ready code, so use at your own risk.
